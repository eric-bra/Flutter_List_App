# listapp

A Flutter Project that utilizes the eSense-Library for flutter.

The aim of this project is to build a simple list app
that is capable of controlling the majority of the app 
with only head movements and voice.

Currently, you are able to iterate through lists and check list items when wearing the eSense-Headphones.

The App is optimized for iOS and deployment on android might fail due to wrong settings.
